TODO:
1. every send should include number of chars in message in first byte and then the message itself.
sendall should send the correct number of bytes and make sure he gets that number returning from send all.
recvall should first read first byte to know how much bytes needs to be read, and then read this amount 
(and make sure it is the value returned from recvall)
(DONE) 2. add password check to server
2.5: change user input to 'User: <user>\n Password: <pass>\n', same with TO,SUBJECT,CONTENT
(DONE for Server) 3. add error handeling for every fu**ing line
(DONE for Server. and it's only for recv) 4. if send or recv return 0 (I think it's 0) it means the other party has disconnected, 
then if it happens, get out of loop for server or terminate if client
5. remove prints who aren't interesting
6. documentation in code and out of code (in the assignment)
7. shutdown bonus
8. memory leaks
(DONE) 9. revert default port to 6423
10. assert that 'mail_client' is inserted (in server also?)
