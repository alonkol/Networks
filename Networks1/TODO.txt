TODO:
ALL DONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE


(DONE) 6. protocol pdf
(DONE) 7. shutdown bonus
(DONE) 2. add password check to server
(DONE) 2.5: change user input to 'User: <user>\n Password: <pass>\n', same with TO,SUBJECT,CONTENT
9. (DONE) revert default port to 6423
(DONE) 3. add error handeling for every fu**ing line
(DONE) 4. if send or recv return 0 (I think it's 0) it means the other party has disconnected, 
then if it happens, get out of loop for server or terminate if client
(DONE) 1. every send should include number of chars in message in first byte and then the message itself.
sendall should send the correct number of bytes and make sure he gets that number returning from send all.
recvall should first read first byte to know how much bytes needs to be read, and then read this amount 
(and make sure it is the value returned from recvall)
(DONE) 11.makefile
8. memory leaks (NO NEED, can't really check for server cause it can't be properly closed only by ctrl-c
Is there suppose to be a way to close it?))
